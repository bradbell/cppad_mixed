Release Notes for 2019
######################

mm-dd
*****

10-08
=====
If :ref:`derived_ctor@A_rcv` is not empty,
*A_rcv* . ``nr`` () > 0 and *A_rcv* . ``nc`` () must equal
:ref:`derived_ctor@n_random` .
If this is not the case, a
:ref:`base_class@User Defined Functions@fatal_error`
message is generated.

09-30
=====
Use a newer version of the program that generates the documentation
``omhelp`` .
The search utility now shows the title and section tag in separate
areas and hides the other keywords.
Hitting return or double clicking in the title area,
in addition to choosing the ``Goto`` button, will go to
the selected section.

07-24
=====
More use of the optimal random effects during initialization
to avoid the Hessian w.r.t. the random effects not being positive definite.

07-23
=====
Do more checking and reporting of non-finite values during the
:ref:`initialize-name` procedure.

07-20
=====
Remove a print statement
(that was used for debugging) from the routine ``ldlt_eigen`` routine.

07-19
=====
Advance to ``cppad-20190719``
(this fixed a problem with the CppAD binary library name on the Mac).

07-10
=====
In the case were :ref:`derived_ctor@quasi_fixed` is false,
a Newton method is used to optimize the fixed effects.
In this case computation of the log of the determinant of the
random Hessian w.r.t.  the random effects
was computed at the initial value for the random effects.
This was changed to use the optimal random effects
corresponding to the initial fixed effects.
This is more robust because the Hessian is more likely to be positive
definite.

07-09
=====
The developer documentation has been separated from the user documentation
and no longer included in the web version displayed on ``github`` .

06-24
=====
Advance to ``cppad-20190623`` .

06-07
=====
Change the ``CppAD::ADFun`` object to check for ``nan`` .
This detects them sooner and gives better error messaging
(when ``NDEBUG`` is not defined).
