Command Arguments
*****************

random_seed
===========
This is a non-negative integer equal to the
seed for the random number generator,
to be specific,
:ref:`manage_gsl_rng@new_gsl_rng@s_in` used during the call to
``new_gsl_rng`` .

number_random
=============
This is a positive integer equal to the number of random effects.
This is also equal to the
number of times at which the measurements are made and is denoted by
:math:`T` below.

quasi_fixed
===========
This is either ``yes`` or ``no`` and is the value of
:ref:`derived_ctor@quasi_fixed` in the
``cppad_mixed`` derived class constructor.
The amount of memory used by the
:ref:`derived_ctor@mixed_derived` object,
after the information matrix is computed,
will be similar to after the initialization when *quasi_fixed* is no.

trace_optimize_fixed
====================
This is either ``yes`` or ``no`` .
If it is yes, a *print_level*  = 5
:ref:`trace<ipopt_trace-name>` of the fixed effects optimization
is included in the program output.
Otherwise the ipopt *print_level* is zero and
no such trace is printed.

ipopt_solve
===========
This is either ``yes`` or ``no`` .
If it is yes, the ``CppAD::ipopt::solve``
routine is used for optimizing the random effects,
otherwise ``CppAD::mixed::ipopt_random`` is used; see
:ref:`optimize_random@options@evaluation_method` .

bool_sparsity
=============
This is either ``yes`` or ``no`` .
If it is yes, boolean sparsity patterns are used for this computation,
otherwise set sparsity patterns are used.

hold_memory
===========
The CppAD memory allocator has a hold memory option will be set by

   ``CppAD::thread_alloc::hold_memory`` ( *hold_memory* );

where *hold_memory* is either ``yes`` or ``no`` .

derivative_test
===============
This is either ``yes`` or ``no`` .
If it is yes, the derivatives of functions used in the optimization
of the fixed effects are checked for correctness.
(This requires extra time).

start_near_solution
===================
This is either ``yes`` or ``no`` .
If it is yes, the initial point for the optimization
is the value of the fixed effects used to simulate the data.
Otherwise, the initial point is significantly different from this value.

number_fixed_samples
====================
This is a positive integer equal to the number of samples simulated
from the posterior distribution for the fixed effects using
:ref:`sample_fixed-name` .
The samples are used to approximation the
standard deviation for the optimal fixed effects.
One should use a large number of samples (at least 100)
for this purpose.

number_locations
================
This is a positive integer equal to the
number of locations at which the measurements are made; i.e.
:math:`R` in the reference.
Increasing this value increases the amount for each function evaluation,
but does not change the number of fixed or random effects.

max_population
==============
This is a positive integer equal to the
maximum value in the finite summation with respect to
population size; i.e.,
:math:`K` in the reference.
This must be greater than any of the simulated number of captures
at any location and time; i.e., and :math:`y_{i,t}`.
Also note that *max_population* does not affect the simulated
data :math:`y_{i,t}`.
A suggested value is five times *mean_population* .
The value of *max_population* is large enough if increasing it
takes more time but does not make a difference in the optimal fixed effects
(use the same value for the other arguments and same actual seed).

mean_population
===============
This is a positive floating point value equal to the
mean of the Poisson distribution for the population
used to simulate data values;
:math:`\lambda` in reference.

mean_logit_probability
======================
This is a positive floating point value equal to the
mean of the logit of the capture probability
(independent of the random effects)
used to simulate data values.
The is also equal to the mean of the random effects.

std_logit_probability
=====================
This is a positive floating point value equal to the
standard deviation of the logit of the capture probability
(independent of the random effects)
used to simulate data values.
The is also equal to the standard deviation of the random effects.

random_constraint
=================
This is either ``yes`` or ``no`` .
If it is ``no`` , there is no
:ref:`random constraint<problem@Maximum Likelihood@Random Constraints>`
for this example.
If it is ``yes`` ,
the random constraint is

.. math::

   0 = \hat{u}_0 ( \theta ) + \cdots + \hat{u}_{T-1} ( \theta )

where :math:`\hat{u} ( \theta )` is the
:ref:`optimal random effects<problem@Notation@Optimal Random Effects, u^(theta)>` .
The corresponding
:ref:`random constraint matrix<problem@Notation@Random Constraint Matrix, A>`
:math:`A` is the row vector of size :math:`T` with all ones; i.e.,

.. math::

   A = [ 1 , \cdots , 1 ] \in \B{R}^{1 \times T}

Output
******
Each output name, value pair is written in as *name* = *value*
where the amount of spaces surrounding the equal sign is not specified.

actual_seed
===========
If *random_seed* is zero,

       (:math:`n_{i,t}` in reference)
   * - :math:`y_i`
     - is the vector of captures at location :math:`i`
       :math:`( y_{i,0} , \ldots , y_{i, T-1} )`.
   * - :math:`M_i`

       (:math:`p_{i,t}` in reference)
   * - :math:`u_t`
     - random effect for each sampling time

p(y_it|N_i,q_t)
***************
We use a binomial distribution to model the
probability of :math:`y_{i,t}` given :math:`N_i` and :math:`q_t`; i.e,

.. math::

   \B{p} ( y_{i,t} | N_i , q_t )
   =
   \left( \begin{array}{c} N_i \\ y_{i,t} \end{array} \right)
   q_t^{y(i,t)} \left( 1 - q_t \right)^{y(i,t)}

Furthermore, we assume that this probability
is independent for each :math:`(i, t)`.

p(N_i|theta)
************
We use a Poisson distribution to model the
probability of :math:`N_i` given :math:`\theta_0`; i.e.,

.. math::

   \B{p} ( N_i | \theta  )
   =
   \theta_0^{N(i)} \frac{ \exp[ - \theta_0 ] }{ N_i ! }

We assume these this probability
is independent for each :math:`i`.

q_t(theta,u)
************
Section 2.4 of the
:ref:`capture_xam.cpp@Reference` suggests a
covariate model for the probability of capture.
We use a similar model defined by

.. math::

   \R{logit} ( q_t ) = u_t + \theta_1

It follows that

.. math::

   q_t( \theta , u) = [ 1 + \exp(- u_t - \theta_1 ) ]^{-1}

M_i
***
We define the vector of maximum measurement for each location by

.. math::

   M_i = \max \left\{ y_{i,0} , \cdots , y_{i, T-1} \right\}

p(y_i|theta,u)
**************
The probability for :math:`y_i` (the captures at location :math:`i`)
given :math:`N_i`, :math:`\theta`, and :math:`u` is

.. math::

   \B{p}( y_i | N_i, \theta , u )
   =
   \prod_{t=0}^{T-1}
   \left( \begin{array}{c} {N(i)} \\ y_{i,t} \end{array} \right)
      q_t ( \theta , u)^{y(i,t)}
      \left( 1 - q_t( \theta , u) \right)^{y(i,t)}

We do not know the population at each location :math:`N_i`,
but instead have a Poisson prior for :math:`N_i`.
We sum with respect to the possible values for :math:`N_i`
to get the probability of :math:`y_i` given
:math:`\theta` and :math:`u`.

.. math::

   \B{p}( y_i | \theta , u )
   =
   \sum_{k=0}^K \B{p}( y_i | N_i=k, \theta , u ) \B{p}( N_i=k | \theta )

where :math:`k` is the possible values for :math:`N_i`.
Note that :math:`K` should be plus infinity, but we use a fixed
finite value for :math:`K` as an approximation for the infinite sum.

p(y|theta,u)
************
Our model for the likelihood of the data at all the locations,
given the fixed and random effects, is

.. math::

   \B{p}( y | \theta , u )
   =
   \prod_{i=0}^{R-1} \B{p}( y_i | \theta , u )

Expressed in terms of fixed effects :math:`\theta`,
the random effects :math:`u`,
and the data :math:`y`, this is

.. math::

   \B{p}( y | \theta , u )
   =
   \prod_{i=0}^{R-1}
   \left[
   \sum_{k=0}^{K-1}
   \theta_0^k \frac{ \exp[ - \theta_0 ] }{ k ! }
   \prod_{t=0}^{T-1}
   \left( \begin{array}{c} {k} \\ y_{i,t} \end{array} \right)
      q_t ( \theta , u)^{y(i,t)}
      \left( 1 - q_t( \theta , u) \right)^{y(i,t)}
   \right]

In ``cppad_mixed`` notation, this specifies the
:ref:`random data density<problem@Notation@Random Data Density, p(y|theta,u)>` .

p(u|theta)
**********
We use a normal distribution, with mean zero and standard deviation
:math:`\theta_2`,
for the distribution of the random effects :math:`u`
given the fixed effects :math:`\theta`; i.e.,

.. math::

   \B{p} ( u | \theta )
   =
   \prod_{t=0}^{T-1}
      \frac{1}{ \theta_2 \sqrt{ 2 \pi } }
         \exp \left[ - \frac{1}{2} \frac{ u_t^2 }{ \theta_2^2 } \right]

In ``cppad_mixed`` notation, this specifies the
:ref:`random prior density<problem@Notation@Random Prior Density, p(u|theta)>` .

p(theta)
********
For this example there is no
:ref:`fixed prior density<problem@Notation@Fixed Prior Density, p(theta)>`
:math:`\B{p}(\theta)`.

p(z|theta)
**********
For this example there is no
:ref:`fixed data density<problem@Notation@Fixed Data Density, p(z|theta)>`
:math:`\B{p}(z | \theta)`.

c(theta)
********
For this example there is no
:ref:`fixed constraint function<problem@Notation@Fixed Constraint Function, c(theta)>`
:math:`c( \theta )`.
