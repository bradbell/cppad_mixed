$section User Defined Class Derived From cppad_mixed$$

$head Syntax$$
$icode%mixed_derived% %mixed_object%(
	%n_fixed%, %n_random%, %quasi_fixed%, %A_info%, %...%
)%$$

$head See Also$$
$cref/initialize/initialize/$$

$head mixed_derived$$
This is the name of the class derived in the following fashion:
$codei%
	class %mixed_derived% : public cppad_mixed {
%$$
The derived class constructor must call its base class constructor as follows:
$codei%
	cppad_mixed(%n_fixed%, %n_random%, %quasi_fixed%, %A_info%)
%$$

$head mixed_object$$
This is the derived class object that is constructed by the syntax above.

$head n_fixed$$
This argument has prototype
$codei%
	size_t %n_fixed%
%$$
and is the number of
$cref/fixed effects/cppad_mixed/Notation/Fixed Effects, theta/$$ in the model.

$head n_random$$
This argument has prototype
$codei%
	size_t %n_random%
%$$
and is the number of
$cref/random effects/cppad_mixed/Notation/Random Effects, u/$$ in the model.
In the case where there are
$cref/no random effects/cppad_mixed/Problem/No Random Effects/$$,
$icode%n_random% = 0%$$.

$head quasi_fixed$$
This argument has prototype
$codei%
	bool %quasi_fixed%
%$$
If it is true, a quasi-Newton method is used to
$cref/optimize the fixed effects/optimize_fixed/$$.
Otherwise a full Newton method is used.
The full Newton method requires much more memory for computation
of second derivatives of the Laplace approximation.

$head A_info$$
This argument has prototype
$codei%
	const CppAD::mixed::sparse_mat_info& %A_info%
%$$
It is a
$cref/sparse matrix/sparse_mat_info/Notation/Sparse Matrix/$$
representation of the
$cref/random constraint matrix
	/cppad_mixed
	/Notation
	/Random Constraint Matrix, A
/$$
$latex A$$.

$head ...$$
Other arguments to the derived class constructor
(that are not used by the base class constructor).

$head Example$$
The file $cref derived_xam.cpp$$ contains an example
that uses this derived class.
